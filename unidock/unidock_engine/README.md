# UD2

Uni-Dock 2.0 C++ engine, working together with unidock_process.

This document serves for Developers, not Users.

## Requirements
* CUDA 11.8+
* CUDA Architecture 70+ 

## How to run it
The input you should prepare is a config.yaml file, definition of which can be found 
in template file `ud2/data/config_template.yaml`.

As illustrated in the yaml file, you should also prepare a json file containing the 
receptor & ligands info, which can be generated by **unidock_process**.

### Example
```shell
cd ud2/test/data/dev1
../../../build/bin/ud2 config.yaml
```

### Different Pre-defined Tasks
Several typical tasks are defined, and you can easily apply them by setting `congfig.yaml`:
```shell
...
Settings:
  task: !!str screen # screen | score | mc | free
...
```
Explaination of pre-defined tasks:

#### screen
Perform standard docking tasks, where ONE receptor and some(>0) ligands are provided. 
For each ligand, `Advanced->exhaustiveness` MC searching tasks will finally generate 
`Advanced->exhaustiveness` poses. After clustered according to `Advanced->rmsd_limit`,
the best `Advanced->num_pose` poses withing the `Advanced->energy_range` kcal/mol
will be output to the result json file, along with their energy terms.

The **energy terms** of one pose is a list of floats, namely `[Predicted Free Energy of Affinity, 
Total Score, Intra-molecular Score, Inter-molecular Score, Conformation-independent Score, 
Penalty Score]`.

#### score
Just provide score for the current pose of each providing ligand. No 
randomization/searching/optimization/clustering/filtering will be performed.
Only the given pose and its energy terms will be saved to the result json file.

#### mc
Only perform Monte Carlo searching to find the best poses. It is usually used to test the 
sampling ability of MC process. In this task, after randomization, the metropolis MC will 
be performed without optimization of each pose. 
clustering/filtering will still be performed.
No refinement.

#### benchmark [Not Loaded]
This is a convenient way to perform benchmark test to check the correctness and speed of UD2.
By given many receptor&best_ligand_pose data, UD2 will first perform "screen" task to find the 
best `num_pose` poses and record their predicted affinity and RMSD from the expected best pose,
along with the total time cost.

Users could perform further analysis based on these data.

#### free
If the pre-defined tasks can't meet your need, pls use `screen` as the task type, and change
detailed settings in `Advanced` as you like, since all provided parameters will take effect for 
`screen` task.
